 abstract = {In the United States, the rate of price inflation falls in recessions.  Turning this observation into a useful inflation forecasting equation is difficult because of multiple sources of time variation in the inflation process, including changes in Fed policy and credibility.  We propose a tightly parameterized model in which the deviation of inflation from a stochastic trend (which we interpret as long-term expected inflation) reacts stably to a new gap measure, which we call the unemployment recession gap.  The short-term response of inflation to an increase in this gap is stable, but the long-term response depends on the resilience, or anchoring, of trend inflation.  Dynamic simulations (given the path of unemployment) match the paths of inflation during post-1960 downturns, including the current one.},

abstract = {We show that high-dimensional econometric models, such as shrinkage and complete subset regression, perform very well in the real-time forecasting of inflation in data-rich environments. We use Brazilian inflation as an application. It is ideal as an example because it exhibits a high short-term volatility, and several agents devote extensive resources to forecasting its short-term behavior. Thus, precise forecasts made by specialists are available both as a benchmark and as an important candidate regressor for the forecasting models. Furthermore, we combine forecasts based on model confidence sets and show that model combination can achieve superior predictive performances.}
