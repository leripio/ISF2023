## Motivation

- Inflation expectations have a direct effect on the yield curve and stocks.
- Large surprises in monthly releases can and do shift expectations accordingly.
- The presence of some very volatile items with a high share in the consumption basket makes short-term inflation particularly hard to forecast.
- Special events such as out-of-season sales, supply disruptions and tax changes pose an additional challenge that statistical models fail to capture.

## What the literature says
::: {style="font-size:25.2pt"}
- @stockwatson2010: "It is exceedingly difficult to improve
systematically upon simple univariate forecasting models".
- @medeiros2021: "Our results show that it is possible to consistently beat univariate benchmarks". 
  - Random Forest using a high dimensional (publicly available) data set.
  - Greater gains for 3-up-to-5 months ahead. 
- Similar results can be found for Brazil, though with additional challenges:
  - Market participants make extensive use of the FGV Monitor, which provides daily figures for every CPI item collected at brick-and-mortar stores.

## The real horse race in Brazil
::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- Dozens of qualified market participants improving their forecasts on a daily basis.
- Highly accurate short-term forecasts: bottom-up approach, high quality data and judgment.

::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- Beating univariate benchmarks is not enough to beat the market (@garcia2017).
- Accuracy: directional and relative to the market. 
- Improving a few basis points over Focus (our target) requires tackling specific items.

## The recent case of Industrial Goods

::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- Large forecast errors for Ind. Goods arguably due to erroneous prediction of perfume prices.
:::

![](images/ind_goods.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- High volatility and large share in the consumption basket means that this item contributes disproportionately to the headline forecasting errors.
:::

## Online prices is a powerful alternative

::: {style="font-size:28pt"}
- Web data usually involves full pass-through and no significant lags compared to brick–and–mortar stores.

- However, both greater product availability and higher frequency data require spending more time on selection tasks.

- In addition, the way we summarize information to compute the indicator is item-specific and may require solid field knowledge. Ex:
  - Perfume: a panel of the same products over time.
  - Electronic devices: constant features (for some time), but products may vary.

## CPI for Perfume

::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- Online prices were able to capture significant events such as out-of-season sales (Aug), black friday (Nov), End-of-year sales (Dec.) and the 'normalization' (Jan). 
:::

## Other examples

::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- Online prices were able to better capture the desinflation following a supply disrupt in the Milk market.
- As with perfume, online prices were also better at capturing the movements of Black Friday for PC.

::: {style="font-size:17pt"}
- The national statistical bureau collects and summarizes each CPI item using different methodologies. A great deal of effort then goes into trying to reproduce the items accordingly.
- Sometimes we're just not measuring the same thing. However, it's still possible to anticipate trends.
:::

## Used cars

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
- We measure the listing price, not the actual deal price.
- In addition to an accurate number, online prices may reveal changes in market trends more timely. 
:::

![](images/auto_usado.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
- During most of the recent period the benchmark showed upward rather than downward level prices.
:::

## Practical result

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
- We cannot rule out the possibility that other players are also using proprietary data.
- However, we can safely state that incorporating new data allowed us to be more accurate compared to the market in the recent period of high volatility.

## Main Takeaways

- It's very unlikely that anyone will be able to outperform the market using only publicly available data.

- There is great potential for improvement by more accurately predicting specific items.

- Short-term forecast can benefit enormously from unstructured data as a whole, not only from websites.  

- Transforming these data into reliable indicators is not trivial, but it surely pays off.

- Finally, I believe that in a short time it will no longer be possible to compete without this type of information.
