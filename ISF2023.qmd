## Motivation

- Inflation expectations have a direct effect on the yield curve and stocks.
- Large surprises in monthly releases can and do shift expectations accordingly.
- The presence of some very volatile items with a high share in the consumption basket makes short-term inflation particularly hard to forecast.
- Special events such as out-of-season sales or supply disruptions pose an additional challenge that statistical models fail to capture.

## The literature

- @stockwatson2010: "It is exceedingly difficult to improve
systematically upon simple univariate forecasting models".
- @medeiros2021: "Our results show that it is possible to consistently beat univariate benchmarks". 
  - Random Forest using a high dimensional (publicly available) data set.
  - Greater gains for 3-up-to-5 months ahead. 

## The real horse race in Brazil

- Dozens of qualified market participants (BCB Focus Survey).
- Highly accurate short-term forecasts.
  - RMSFE: 0.95 (Focus) vs. 2.41 (RW).
    - Bottom-up approach and Judgment.
- Low dispersion (on average, 3/4 of predictions differ by less than 10bps).
- Beating univariate benchmarks is not enough to beat the market (@garcia2017)
- It's mandatory to tackle specific items in the hierarchy.

## The recent case of Industrial Goods

- Large forecast errors for Ind. Goods arguably due to erroneous prediction of perfume prices.

- High volatility and large share in the consumption basket means that this item contributes disproportionately to the headline forecasting errors.
- And the lack of a reliable explanatory variable makes this item an obvious candidate for improving overall accuracy.
:::

## Online prices is a powerful alternative

- Web data usually involves full pass-through and no significant lags compared to brick–and–mortar stores.

- However, both greater product availability and higher frequency data require spending more time on selection tasks.

- In addition, the way we summarize information to compute the indicator is item-specific and may require solid field knowledge.

## Application: CPI for Perfume

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
1. Collect prices from the most representative brands on a daily basis.

2. Select the most popular products for each brand.

3. Compute baskets subject to market share constraints.

4. Choose a set of baskets based on out-of-sample performance.

## More conventional examples

:::

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
- The national statistical bureau collects and summarizes each CPI item using different methodologies. A great deal of effort goes into trying to reproduce accordingly.
- Sometimes we're just not measuring the same thing. However, it's still possible to anticipate trends.
  - Example: Used cars
:::

## Used cars

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
- We measure the listing price, not the actual deal price.
- Rather than an accurate number, online prices may reveal changes in market trends. 
:::

![](images/auto_usado.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size:18pt"}
- To be fair, during most of the recent period the indicator most used by the market showed upward rather than downward prices.
:::

## Main Takeaways

- It's very unlikely that anyone will be able to outperform the market using conventional data.

- There is great potential for improvement by more accurately predicting specific items.

- Short-term forecast can benefit enormously from unstructured data as a whole, not only from websites.  

- Transforming these data into reliable indicators is not trivial, but it surely pays off.

- Finally, it's no longer possible to compete without this type of information.
